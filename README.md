Tic Tac Toe with test
# Running the Tests
To ensure the Tic Tac Toe game functions as expected, we've provided a suite of unit tests. You can easily run these tests to verify the game's functionality.
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
The game and tests have been developed with Python 3.8, but should be compatible with other Python 3 versions.
## How to Run the Tests
1. Open your command line interface (CLI).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game's code.
3. Run the following command:
    python -m unittest tests.py
This command will execute all the tests in `tests.py` and output the results in your CLI. If all tests pass, you'll see a success message. Any failures or errors will be detailed in the output.
